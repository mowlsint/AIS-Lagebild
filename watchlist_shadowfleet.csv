The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. The tanker is affiliated with Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE, under UK sanctions for its involvement in servicing the energy sector of the russian economy). Fractal Marine DMCC is considered to be one of the leading operators of the so-called shadow fleet involved in the export of russian crude oil/oil products under Western sanctions in 2022-2023. The shipping company Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE) was established shortly before the G7 countries introduced a price-cap policy on russian crude oil/oil products and played a significant role in the transportation of russian crude oil/oil products under sanctions. The tanker is also affiliated with Macario Shipping LLC (UAE), which fleet participated in the sanctioned trade. The vessel",9282041,,,,

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. The oil tanker is affiliated with the sanctioned company Shanghai Future Ship Management Co LTD (China), which for years has been managing illegal shipments of Iranian oil. This company managed the Panamanian-flagged MT Freya, which, together with the Iranian-flagged MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company (a subsidiary of the sanctioned National Iranian Oil Company), was arrested by Indonesia in January 2021 on suspicion of illegal oil transportation in the country's waters. The tanker calls at russian ports, which are the leaders among the ports from which russian oil is exported by the shadow fleet - the ports of Ust-Luga, Primorsk in the Baltic Sea, Novorossiysk in the Black Sea, delivering oil to the countries that import the most russian crude oil through the shadow fleet - China, India. The tanker is flying the flag of Panama, which, along with Liberia, Gabon, the Cook Islands, and the Marshall Islands, is the leader in the flags under which shadow tankers carrying russian oil are flying. The shadow fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The shadow fleet continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental safety threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

In 2024, the tanker transported russian oil from the port of Primorsk to India. The transportation was carried out under the command of Captain Konstantin Kovalenko. The tanker is affiliated with Prominent Shipmanagement LTD, a company established in Hong Kong in 2022, which was sanctioned by the US on January 10, 2025, for its activities in the energy sector of the russian federation. All tankers operated by the Dubai-based company K&O Shipmanagement FZE, affiliated with the sanctioned russian PJSC Sovcomflot, were transferred to the management of Prominent Shipmanagement LTD. The vessels were included in the Indian Register of Shipping (the classification society with the largest market share of the so-called shadow fleet). Sovcomflot PJSC is russia's largest state-owned shipping company providing services and support for offshore hydrocarbon production and the transportation of russian oil, petroleum products, and liquefied gas. The main charterers of Sovcomflot PJSC vessels are russia's largest oil and gas companies and traders.

The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Caishan Ship Management, which is affiliated with Gatik, which in 2023, together with Gaurik Ship Management LLP, Galena Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management LLP, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Caishan Ship Management were the previous managers of the tanker. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of ""juggling"" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. The 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. 'Shadow' tankers have already been involved in 50 incidents from the Danish Straits all the way to Malaysia since russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. russia's 'shadow fleet' continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On November 25, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a tanker in connection with the transportation of russian oil/oil products from the russian federation to a third country as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel",9314167,,,,

The vessel is engaged in unlawful oil and natural gas exploration in the Antarctic. In January 2023, it docked in South Africa en route to Antarctica, provoking criticism from local activists over potential support to moscow in conducting mineral exploration in the Antarctic and violating the international ban on such activities. The global environmental movement Extinction Rebellion has linked the vessel’s activities to future mineral extraction in the region. On 23 February 2024, the United States imposed sanctions on the vessel for large-scale oil and gas exploration in the Southern Ocean of Antarctica – a marine desert under threat from greenhouse gas emissions and extreme weather events. Much of this exploration has been conducted via Cape Town since the entry into force of the international moratorium on mining in 1998. The vessel is owned by the sanctioned russian company Polar Marine Geosurvey Expedition JSC (АО ""Полярная морская геологоразведочная экспедиция""), a subsidiary of Rosgeologia JSC (АО ""Росгеология""), the russian state-owned diversified geological holding.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/19/8f/198f167f0afddaba9544cd79af43a4a064f6ea95fe851ed72842619f8881aa04-medium.webp"" alt=""AKADEMIK CHERSKIY"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> AKADEMIK CHERSKIY </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 8770261 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/ru.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='russian federation'> <span class='ml-2'>russian federation</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Pipe-laying Vessel </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Other</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Involvement in energy projects</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The crane and pipe-laying vessel combines the functions of a crane ship and a pipelayer.

Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly ""juggling"" (transferring) vessels to affiliated companies.

Since June 2021, the tanker has been owned by the russian company SBC Dolina LLC (TIN: 7714420564), whose founder since October 23, 2020 is the russian company LSCapital LLC (TIN: 7703426420). Since April 11, 2022, the beneficiaries of LSCapital LLC are Aslan Pashaev (TIN: 771917667217) with a share of 75%, Alexander Lapko (TIN: 771515523462) with a share of 25%. Aslan Pashayev is the CEO of LSCapital LLC and Oleksandr Lapko is the CEO of SBC Dolina LLC. SBC Dolina LLC is associated with the russian Sberbank, which held the vessel as a pledge as of the date of sale by the previous owner. Pashayev Aslan Jamaldinovich is probably the son of the Astrakhan businessman Pashayev Jamaldin Emirmagomedovich, who owns/controls a network of russian shipping companies operating in the port of Olya in the Astrakhan region of the russian federation. Jamaldin Pashayev's companies have been involved in russian military exports since 2021 and have concluded more than 200 agreements on the sea transportation of military cargo around the world. Jamaldin Pashayev and his companies have been an integral part of the ongoing transfer of lethal aid to the sanctioned russian company SEZ Alabuga, which is one of the main UAV assembly plants for the russian Ministry of defense with the support of Iran. Jamaldin Pashayev is affiliated with the sanctioned shipping company MG-Flot LLC, whose fleet is involved in the transportation of weapons from Syria, Iran, North Korea to russia, as well as Iranian oil. Oleksandr Lapko is probably connected to the banking sector, having held senior positions at VTB Bank (russia), in 2013 at Alfa Bank (Ukraine), etc. The tanker is affiliated with the russian company Eneya LLC (TIN: 6164136080), which actually manages the vessel. Eneya LLC is affiliated with Jamaldin Pashayev and is involved in covert supplies to Syria in the interests of the russian Ministry of defense (in particular, aviation fuel), and owns a fleet of 15 oil tankers. Since October 2024, CEO of Eneya LLC is Magomed Abdulatipov (TIN: 053689064586), who for a long period of time before October 2024 was the head of the Federal State Budgetary Institution ""Administration of the Caspian Sea Seaports"".

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadowy fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. The tanker is affiliated with the Turkish company Beks Tanker Isletmeciligi AS, which was the commercial and ISM manager of the vessel from October 2023 to March 2024. Beks Tanker Isletmeciligi AS is one of the top three ranking Turkish operators, which in 2023 provided transportation of hundreds of millions of barrels of russian oil and oil products. The fleet of the Turkish top three - Beks Tanker Isletmeciligi AS and the sanctioned Beks Gemi Isletmeciligi ve Tic and Active Denizcilik ve Gemi - transported a total of 49 million barrels of russian oil/oil products in 2023. Since March 2024, the tanker has been managed by the Turkish company Tokyo Gemi Isletmeciligi AS. Tokyo Gemi Isletmeciligi AS has the same legal address as two other Turkish ship managers, Sand Gemi Isletmeciligi AS and Cape Gemi Isletmeciligi AS. Eight tankers of these companies were operated by Beks Tanker Isletmeciligi AS in 2023 and early 2024, and one tanker was operated by the sanctioned Beks Gemi Isletmeciligi ve Tic. On May 20, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.

The tanker is affiliated with another Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the related company Plutos Ship Management, which in 2023, along with Caishan Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Gaurik Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management, Nautilus Shipping, Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Plutos Ship Management were the previous managers of the tanker. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of ""juggling"" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. The 'shadow fleet' of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. In June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.

Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani–the son of Ali Shamkhani, the chief political adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader–has leveraged his father’s political influence to corrupt senior officials of the Iranian regime and to build and operate an extensive fleet of tankers and container vessels. This fleet transports crude oil and refined petroleum products originating from Iran and the russian federation, as well as other cargoes, to customers worldwide, generating revenues in the tens of billions of dollars. The Shamkhani-controlled shipping network comprises a large fleet of vessels, ship-management companies, and front (shell) companies that launder billions of dollars in proceeds from the global sale of crude oil and petroleum products from Iran and the russian federation, predominantly to buyers in the People’s Republic of China. The network undertakes extensive measures to conceal its operations and to obscure links to the Shamkhani family, Iran, and the russian federation.

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow"" fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Gaurik Ship Management, which is related to Gatik, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management, Nautilus Shipping, Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels managed by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Gaurik Ship Management were the previous managers of the tanker. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of ""juggling"" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. The shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.

At that time, the fleet of Fractal Marine Shipping, Radiating World Shipping Services and Gatik Ship Management consisted of about 90 tankers, 90% of which transported oil and oil products from the Baltic and Black Sea ports of russia to India, China, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and South America. In order to circumvent the sanctions, Radiating World Shipping Services 're-registered' its fleet to related companies. Tankers operated/managed by Radiating World Shipping Services LLC continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. The 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The recent incidents off Malaysia only underscore the need for swift action to curb the potentially devastating impact of the growing 'shadow fleet'. 'Shadow' tankers have already been involved in 50 incidents from the Danish Straits all the way to Malaysia since russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to CREA, from January to August 2024, the number of shadow tankers crossing the Danish Straits in Europe increased by 277% compared to the same period in 2022, with 64% of the 46 million tons of russian marine oil transported through the Danish Straits being transported by shadow tankers. In the same period, the number of shadow tankers in the Straits of Dover and Gibraltar increased by 355% compared to 2022, transporting 67% of the 37 million tons of oil through the straits. The Suez Canal experienced a staggering 649% increase in shadow tanker traffic, with 69% of the 52 million tons of russian crude oil passing through it being transported by these vessels. Thus, the 'shadow fleet' of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33) (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025). In June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel. On June 19, 2025, New Zealand imposed sanctions on the vessel.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/435""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/2f/6f/2f6f03b8c34bf49204fb1731d3d79ea21835c2f6e631494fbc06b743ccc24473-medium.webp"" alt=""SWIFTSEA RIDER"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> SWIFTSEA RIDER </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9318539 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/km.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='Comoro Islands'> <span class='ml-2'>Comoro Islands</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Crude Oil Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Transporting russian crude oil/oil products in violation of other restrictions</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">During the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and the price-cap policy on russian oil, the tanker was involved in the export of oil to third countries from russian ports, resorting to the practice of turning off the AIS signal, conducting so-called 'dark activities' at sea. The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. The vessel is certified by the Chinese regulator China Classification Society (IACS). The tanker is affiliated with One Moon Marine Services LLC (UAE), which was sanctioned by the United Kingdom on June 13, 2024, due to the company's involvement in benefiting from or supporting the russian government by doing business in a sector of strategic importance to the russian government, namely the russian energy sector. Since November 2023, One Moon Marine Services LLC has started transporting russian oil without P&I insurance. One Moon Marine Services LLC is affiliated with the so-called 'shadow' fleet operators Radiating World Shipping Services and Star Voyages Shipping Services. In order to circumvent the sanctions imposed on the shadow fleet operators, in particular, Radiating World Shipping Services and Star Voyages Shipping Services, the operators 're-registered' their fleet to six related companies, in particular, four tankers (including the sanctioned 'OZANNO' (former name 'Ocean Amz')) were transferred to the newly established One Moon Marine Services LLC. The constant change of owners and managers of vessels to avoid sanctions and conceal the true beneficiaries of the vessels is a typical phenomenon for the so-called 'shadow fleet' involved in the russian oil and oil products trade. The 'shadow fleet' of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33); promoting or supporting actions/policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025). The vessel is used by russia as a spy platform aimed at monitoring NATO navy and air activities. According to the British publication Lloyd's List, the tanker Swiftsea Rider and the tanker Eagle S, arrested by Finland for damaging the Estlink 2 submarine cable on December 25, 2024, ""were equipped with listening and receiving devices to monitor NATO navy ships and aircraft."" The Eagle S and Swiftsea Rider tankers are linked to the same shadowy network created in the interests of the sanctioned russian Lukoil, when, under sanctions on russian oil, more than 20 tankers were purchased in 2022-2023 and transferred under a bareboat charter to Eiger Shipping by the shipping division of the russian oil trader Litasco, affiliated with Lukoil. According to a Financial Times investigation, the purchased tankers were transferred under the Cook Islands flag and under the management of sanctioned Dubai companies - Radiating World Shipping (16 vessels) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (6 vessels). In June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.

On November 25, 2024, United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a tanker in connection with the transportation of russian crude oil/oil products from russia to a third country as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 24, 2025, EU imposed sanctions on a tanker associated with a sanctioned person as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet (the sanctions come into force on February 25, 2025).

The tanker was also used to transport Iranian oil under sanctions. The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. The vessel is affiliated with Sun Ship Management, a sanctioned company associated with the sanctioned Sovcomflot, the largest state-owned shipping company in russia for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas. The main charterers of Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', 'Sakhalin-2', 'Varandey', 'Prirazlomnoye', 'Novy Port', 'Yamal LNG' and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani leverages his father’s political influence to corrupt senior Iranian regime officials to build and operate a vast fleet of tankers and container ships. This fleet transports oil and petroleum products from Iran and russia, as well as other cargoes, to customers around the world, generating tens of billions of dollars in profits. His shipping empire consists of a large fleet of vessels, ship management firms, and front companies that launder billions of dollars in proceeds from global sales of Iranian and russian crude oil and petroleum products, primarily to buyers in China.

Until 2022, the tanker was not involved in the transportation of russian oil. The vessel is certified by the China Classification Society (IACS). Oil exports are ussia's largest source of revenue. From February 2022 to June 2024, russia earned 475 billion euros in oil export revenues (68% of all fossil fuel export revenues). In 2023, about a third of all tax revenues in russia came from the sale of oil and gas. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by 'shadow' tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries implementing price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September. Today, russia continues to make efforts to avoid/ circumvent sanctions, expand its shadow fleet with a growing number of outdated, poorly maintained vessels, use a 'ghost armada', many of which have experience in working under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran and Venezuela, use 'convenient' flags for vessel registration, complex ownership and management structures, and employ various tactics to conceal the origin of their cargo, including ship-to-shore transshipment (STS), disabling automatic identification systems (AIS), falsifying positions, transmitting false data, and other deceptive or even illegal methods. russia's shadow fleet, operating with minimal compliance with the rules and transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with the automatic identification system disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. Since September 18, 2025, Australia has imposed sanctions on the vessel.

The vessel is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow fleet', which has become the largest carrier of russian oil under sanctions since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of ""juggling"" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. On February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

The Israeli Ministry of Defense accuses the tanker ІМО 9235725 of transporting Iranian oil for the Quds Force and Hezbollah. The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. The tanker is affiliated with the Cypriot company Lagosmarine Ltd (НE 402876) as the former manager of the vessel. The company's director is Δακης Μαυρουδης, who, in turn, is a director of another Cypriot company, Sparta Shipmanagement Limited (ΗΕ 393698). Lagosmarine Ltd and Sparta Shipmanagement Limited are registered at the same address in Cyprus. At the same time, Sparta Shipmanagement Limited is affiliated with Latvian citizen Alexey Haliavins, who in 2024 'helped' one of the largest russian oil and gas companies, Surgutneftegaz, to earn $1.4 billion on oil sales above the price ceiling for russian oil set by sanctions. In 2022, Haliavins claimed to be the general manager of Sparta Shipmanagement Limited, as well as the chairman of the board of directors and ultimate beneficial owner of the OGC group. Three Dubai-based companies are associated with Oleksiy Haliavins: Black Pearl Energy Trading LLC, OGC Shipping LLC, and Conmar Maritime. In 2023, Black Pearl Energy Trading LLC and OGC Shipping LLC purchased about 38 million barrels of oil from the russian company Surgutneftegaz at an average price of $83.7 per barrel, which exceeds the price cap for russian oil. In January-May 2024, only Black Pearl Energy Trading bought oil from the russian company, purchasing more than 20.6 million barrels at $83.7. As a result, the russian Surgutneftegaz earned about $1.4 billion bypassing the price ceiling. At the same time, tankers registered to Lagosmarine Ltd, which is affiliated with Sparta Shipmanagement Limited through a joint director, are constantly making voyages between the russian ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga, Kozmino and India and China. According to customs documents, the same routes were used to move oil sold to Dubai companies linked to Haliavins. In his LinkedIn profile, Haliavins lists himself as a beneficiary and CEO of Conrad Management Company, which is listed as a sponsor company in the UAE residence permits of employees of the russian state-owned company JSC Foreign Economic Association Promsyryoimport (TIN 9704027750, sanctioned by USA and Ukraine). This russian company is involved in schemes to supply Iranian oil to Syria and the TOT of Crimea. The shadow tanker fleet continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin by circumventing sanctions by disguising its activities under third-country flags, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental safety hazards with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequately insured shadow fleet tankers. On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. Since September 18, 2025, Australia has imposed sanctions on the vessel.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/466""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/27/75/2775fdc608a6d066ec0e8be39b4cd49b9e79cfd61f23170a5f84d6c28bab356b-medium.webp"" alt=""MEROPE"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> MEROPE </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9281891 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> unknown </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Crude Oil Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Transporting russian crude oil/oil products in violation of other restrictions</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">During the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and price-cap policy on russian crude oil, the tanker is involved in the export of russian oil from russian ports in the Baltic, Black seas, and the Pacific region, mainly to China. According to the USA-based human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and switched to transporting russian oil in March 2022. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to a 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. The tanker was illegally transporting hundreds of thousands of metric tons of Iranian oil on behalf of, among others, the sanctioned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world and is controlled by the Ministry of Oil of Iran. NIOC and its subsidiaries explore, produce, transport, process and export oil and natural gas in Iran. The oil deals of NIOC, including its subsidiaries, provide the Iranian regime with resources to finance its nuclear program, develop advanced drones and missiles, and provide ongoing financial and material support for the terrorist activities of its regional proxies. The international public organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. On December 03, 2024, USA imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on vessels that play a critical role in the transportation of illicit Iranian petroleum to foreign markets. On February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33) (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025). In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.

The tanker is managed by Prominent Shipmanagement LTD, established in 2022 in Hong Kong. Prominent is headed by Arjun Deshmukh, who worked for FESCO Wallem Shipmanagement, a joint venture between a russian company and Hong Kong's oldest ship manager. Prominent Shipmanagement LTD took over all tankers operated by K&O Shipmanagement FZE, a Dubai-based company. On December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular and risky shipping practices, as set out in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33). On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. The tanker was calling at a russian port, where oil is constantly trading at a price well above $60. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. The vessel is affiliated with Caishan Ship Management, an Indian company associated with Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions. Caishan Ship Management is one of a number of Indian companies that in 2023 were involved in a scheme to 'juggle' shadow fleet vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management in order to avoid Western sanctions. Caishan Ship Management was the vessel's safety management manager in January-March 2024.

The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Maritas Fleet Private Ltd, which was the ISM manager of the vessel from December 2022 to February 2024. The dominance of India as the technical and ISM manager of shadow fleet tankers may indicate the creation of a control center for shadow fleet vessels, masking the beneficial owners. Established in 2022, Maritas Fleet Private Ltd has managed 29 tankers, including those under sanctions, affiliated with the sanctioned company Hennesea Holdings Limited. Hennesea Holdings Limited was founded in late 2022 in the UAE and owned 18 vessels that transported crude oil of russian origin at a price above $60 per barrel. Shortly before the introduction of the price-cap policy, the company acquired old tankers involved in the transportation of russian crude oil and petroleum products with calls to russian ports. On May 20, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. From July 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions on a tanker for transporting crude oil/petroleum products that originate in russia or are exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33).

The tanker is linked to sanctioned companies Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE), Wanta Shipping LLC-FZ (UAE), Algae Ship Charter FZCO (UAE), and The Zulu Ships Management and Operation — Sole Proprietorship LLC (UAE), which managed the vessel in 2022-2024. Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE) is considered one of the leading operators of the shadow fleet, which in early 2023 was among the three largest carriers of russian oil, together with Radiating World Shipping Services LLC (UAE) and Gatik Ship Management (India), and played a significant role in the export of russian crude oil to countries around the world during the period of sanctions restrictions. Fractal Marine DMCC managed a fleet of 28 tankers as an intermediary between shipowners and charterers. Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE), Wanta Shipping LLC-FZ (UAE), Algae Ship Charter FZCO (UAE), The Zulu Ships Management and Operation — Sole Proprietorship LLC (UAE) are part of a shipping empire controlled by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Ali Shamkhani, the chief political advisor to Iran's supreme leader. Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani uses his father's political influence to corrupt top-level officials in the Iranian regime in order to build and operate a huge fleet of tankers and container ships. This fleet transports oil and petroleum products from Iran and russia, as well as other cargoes, to buyers around the world, generating tens of billions of dollars in profits. Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani's shipping empire consists of a vast fleet of vessels, ship management companies, and front companies that launder billions of dollars in profits from the global sale of Iranian and russian crude oil and petroleum products, mostly to buyers in the PRC. The shipping empire takes significant measures to conceal its operations and obscure its ties to the Shamkhani family, Iran, and russia. Fractal Marine DMCC played an important role in the management and operation of the tanker and container ship fleet of Mohammed Hossein Shamkhani's shipping network. Algae Ship Charter FZCO, Wanta Shipping LLC-FZ (UAE), and The Zulu Ships Management and Operation — Sole Proprietorship LLC (UAE) provide operational services for the fleet of Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani's shipping network.

The main charterers of Sovcomflot's vessels are russia's largest oil and gas companies and traders. Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: ""Sakhalin-1, Sakhalin-2, Varandey, Prirazlomnoye, Novy Port, Yamal LNG, and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly ""juggling"" (transferring) vessels to affiliated companies. According to expert estimates, the tankers transferred by Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called ""shadow tanker fleet"" of the russian federation to continue selling russian oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas under western sanctions. In July 2024, UK imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of russian oil and/or oil products from russia to third countries.

The tanker is affiliated with Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE, under UK sanctions), one of the leading operators of the so-called shadow fleet involved in the export of russian crude oil/oil products in 2022-2023. The shipping company Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE) was established shortly before the G7 countries introduced a price-cap policy on russian oil after russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and played a significant role in the transportation of russian oil. On February 22, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Fractal Marine DMCC in connection with its involvement in servicing the russian energy sector. Fractal Marine DMCC operated a fleet of 28 tankers as an intermediary between ship owners and charterers. Fractal Marine DMCC, together with Gatik Ship Management (India) and Radiating World Shipping Services LLC (UAE, under UK sanctions), are considered to be the leading operators of the russian shadow fleet, which in early 2023 assembled a fleet of about 90 tankers, 90% of which transported russian crude oil/oil products from the Baltic and Black Seas ports of russia to India, China, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and South America. In less than a year, the $2 billion fleet of oil tankers assembled by Fractal and Gatik could transport more than 40 million barrels of crude oil/oil products. Fractal Marine DMCC, Gatik Ship Management and Radiating World Shipping Services LLC in the tanker market helped russian crude oil continue to circulate around the world and the russian government to generate multibillion-dollar revenues bypassing the sanctions. After Fractal Marine was sanctioned, DMCC tried to challenge the sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom but lost in court. After that, the company ""re-signed"" its fleet to other companies. The safety management of the tanker in 2023-2024 was carried out by Wanta Shipping LLC-FZ (UAE), which also managed 19 other vessels affiliated with Fractal Marine DMCC. The vessel",9433016,,,,

Under the sanctions, russia has begun to build up its own shadow fleet of outdated tankers, which has no 'ties' with the G7 and the EU and can transport oil in violation of price caps. russia disguises its shadow activities at sea under the 'convenient' flags of third countries, operates at sea without proper insurance from the international club of insurers, uses complex schemes to conceal the owners of the shadow fleet, uses various deceptive tactics to conceal the origin of its cargo, creates threats to environmental safety with large-scale economic costs for coastal countries due to the growing threat of oil spills, does not use pilots to navigate difficult areas, etc. russia's 'shadow fleet' continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On November 25, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a tanker in connection with the transportation of russian oil/oil products from the russian federation to a third country as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

The members of the combined detachment were identified as belonging to certain specialised units of the russian Navy: – a four-person group from the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research of the russian ministry of defense (Главное управление глубоководных исследований Министерства обороны российской федерации), also known as Military Unit No. 45707 – one of russia’s most classified military units, which plans and conducts special underwater operations, engages in reconnaissance on the seabed, installs various equipment, and collects wreckage of vessels, aircraft, and satellites to assess the technological level of potential adversaries; this unit is also involved in the planning and pre-deployment for large-scale sabotage operations against transatlantic fiber-optic communication lines between Europe and North America; – a seven-person group from the 313th Separate Special-Purpose Detachment for Combating Underwater Sabotage Forces of the Baltic Fleet; – a seven-person group from the 342nd Emergency and Rescue Detachment of the Baltic Fleet. The heightened activity of the combined detachment was recorded within the exclusive economic zones of Denmark and Germany, in proximity to the underwater fiber-optic cables ""Baltica"" (linking Poland, Sweden, and Denmark) and ""Denmark– Poland-2"" (linking Poland with the island of Bornholm), at a distance of 2– 3 nautical miles from the pipeline route.

Earlier in April 2023, the vessel also transported crude oil and oil products from russian ports in the Black Seas. The vessel is owned and managed by Elizario Shipping Inc (Mauritius), whose fleet consists of this vessel only. This company is another owner and commercial manager of the oil tanker from the ""shadow fleet"".

Gatik Ship Management has become the largest carrier of russian oil since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine. The company was used to operate russia's ""shadow fleet"" of oil transport, and the British regulator Lloyd's Register has withdrawn the certification of 21 of the company's vessels. A major insurance company, American Club (USA), also announced that it no longer provides coverage for Gatik vessels. In June 2024, EU imposed sanctions on the vessel due to its involvement in the transportation of russian oil and/or oil products from russia to third countries, as well as its participation in the circumvention of european restrictions.

According to the data of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) , which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and has switched to transporting russian oil since October 2024. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 100 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. The tanker is affiliated with Delnaz Ship Management Sdn Bhd, which was sanctioned by USA on October 11, 2024 for providing material, sponsorship or financial, material or technological support, or goods or services to support the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) within the framework of expanding restrictions on the oil and petrochemical sector of Iran. On October 11, 2024, USA imposed sanctions on the tanker as a property in which Delnaz Ship Management Sdn Bhd has an interest. According to GISIS IMO data as of July 15, 2025, the vessel's registered name is CROSS OCEAN, the flag is unknown. At the same time, the vessel sails under the name BLUEBELL, the flag of Curacao.

The vessel exported russian crude oil from the russian port of Primorsk in the Baltic Sea in May 2024 and transported it to a transshipment point near the port of Nador (Morocco) and the Spanish port of Melilla. The vessel is affiliated with a sanctioned company One Moon Marine Services LLC (UAE) with a non-transparent organizational and ownership structure. One Moon Marine Services LLC is involved in a network of companies along with other UAE-based companies - Alqutb Alshamali Marine, Almuhit Alhadi Marine, Oceanlink Maritime, Symphony Marine - to which tankers carrying russian oil (oil products) were 'registered', managed, in particular, by one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet - the sanctioned company Radiating World Shipping Services. The constant change of owners and managers of vessels to avoid sanctions and conceal the true beneficiaries of the vessels is a typical phenomenon for the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the russian oil and oil products trade. On October 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on tankers of the russian so-called 'shadow' fleet, including the tanker ІМО 9285835.

In particular, in December 2023, the vessel transported russian oil from the port of Novorossiysk ( russia) to the EU countries through a transshipment in the Lakonikos Bay. The international public organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under western sanctions, and the company Galena Ship Management, which is affiliated with Gatik, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Gaurik Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management, Nautilus Shipping, Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagement, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Galena Ship Management were the previous managers of the tanker. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of ""juggling"" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. On April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of the tanker",9296406,,,,

The vessel calls at ports in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, in particular at the port of Kamysh-Burun in June 2025. Since December 2023, the tanker has been owned by Marinequest Corp (IMO 6437580), registered in the Seychelles (Suite 10, 3rd Floor, La Ciotat, Mont Fleuri, Mahe Island Seychelles), which is widely used to register shipping companies with an opaque ownership structure, and in July 2024 the same company became the commercial manager of the vessel. In the period from January to July 2024, the tanker was affiliated with the Moldovan company Surt Ship Management SRL, which was the commercial and technical manager of the vessel during this period. This Moldovan company is one of ten Moldovan companies that played a significant role in the maritime transportation of russian crude oil and petroleum products in 2024. In July 2024, the technical management was transferred to Vvave Minder Shipmanagement (Azerbaijan), while the owner of the tanker did not change, which may indicate that the beneficiary of the vessel has not changed. Since March 2025, the technical management has been transferred to another company from Azerbaijan - Tidal Tech Mariners LLC, whose fleet as of May 26, 2025 consists of four tankers, including sanctioned ones (IMO 926165,",9265873,,,,

In February-March 2024, the tanker transported russian oil from the russian port of Novorossiysk in the Black sea to the port of Zhoushan (China). In May-June 2024, the tanker transported russian oil from the russian port of Ust-Luga in the Baltic Sea to the port of Sikka (India). In February 2023, the tanker was detained in Ferrol (Spain) under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control after authorities found ‘technical and documentary deficiencies’ during an inspection in the northwestern port of Ferrol. Spain has fined Vietnamese operator Hung Phat Maritime Trading EUR 120 thousand for a ship-to-ship transshipment operation that took place outside the port boundaries but in Spanish territorial waters. The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. From July 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions on a tanker for transporting crude oil/petroleum products that originate in russia or are exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33).

The vessel is connected with the facts of supplying crude oil (a refined product) to China in October 2023 (for the needs of a large Shengxing Chemical refinery) under the guise of 'other fuel oil' (a combustion product), which may indicate concealment of the nature/origin of the cargo, avoidance of price caps in certain geographical locations, disguising the real cargo under a different product classification code to conceal its potential use, etc. Since early 2023, Borey G's voyage history has identified a number of sailing routes between Southeast Asia and mainland China's coastal ports, with several STS activities near Malaysia using crude oil tankers MS Enola and FSO SA Europe. According to the USA-based human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and has switched to transporting russian oil since December 2022. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to a 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

In September 2021, the United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) included the tanker in a public list of vessels suspected of involvement in the illegal transportation of Iranian oil. russia has created its own shadow fleet of tankers, mostly made up of old tankers, many of which have experience in operating under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 100 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI predicted that russia would use a 'ghost armada' to ensure that excess profits from oil exports flow to its Chinese partner, in particular. The shadow tanker fleet continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin by circumventing sanctions by disguising its activities under third-country flags, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental safety hazards with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequately insured shadow fleet tankers. On May 20, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.

From November 2021 to January 2025, the sanctioned Cyprus company Lagosmarine Ltd ( ΗΕ 402876) was the commercial and ISM manager of the tanker. The company's director is Dakis Mauroudis, who, in turn, is a director of another Cypriot company, Sparta Shipmanagement Limited (ΗΕ 393698). Lagosmarine Ltd and Sparta Shipmanagement Limited are registered at the same address in Cyprus. At the same time, Sparta Shipmanagement Limited is affiliated with Latvian citizen Alexey Haliavins, who in 2024 'helped' one of the largest russian oil and gas companies, Surgutneftegaz, to earn $1.4 billion on oil sales above the price ceiling for russian oil set by sanctions. In 2022, Haliavins claimed to be the general manager of Sparta Shipmanagement Limited, as well as the chairman of the board of directors and ultimate beneficial owner of the OGC group. Three Dubai-based companies are associated with Oleksiy Haliavins: Black Pearl Energy Trading LLC, OGC Shipping LLC, and Conmar Maritime. In 2023, Black Pearl Energy Trading LLC and OGC Shipping LLC purchased about 38 million barrels of oil from the russian company Surgutneftegaz at an average price of $83.7 per barrel, which exceeds the price cap for russian oil. In January-May 2024, only Black Pearl Energy Trading bought oil from the russian company, purchasing more than 20.6 million barrels at $83.7. As a result, the russian Surgutneftegaz earned about $1.4 billion bypassing the price ceiling. At the same time, tankers registered to Lagosmarine Ltd, which is affiliated with Sparta Shipmanagement Limited through a joint director, are constantly making voyages between the russian ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga, Kozmino and India and China. According to customs documents, the same routes were used to move oil sold to Dubai companies linked to Halsavins. The Israeli Ministry of Defense accuses one of Lagosmarine's tankers, ІМО 9235725, in transporting Iranian oil for the Quds Force and Hezbollah. According to the United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), the vessel ІМО 9282792 was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and since January 2022 has switched to transporting russian oil. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 100 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In his LinkedIn profile, Haliavins lists himself as a beneficiary and CEO of Conrad Management Company, which is listed as a sponsor company in the UAE residence permits of employees of the russian state-owned company JSC Foreign Economic Association Promsyryoimport (TIN 9704027750, sanctioned by USA and Ukraine). This russian company is involved in schemes to supply Iranian oil to Syria and the TOT of Crimea. On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. According to the database of the Global Integrated Shipping Information System of the International Maritime Organization (IMO's GISIS) as of July 28, 2025, the vessel's registered name is AQUA LIVE, the flag is indicated as ""Aruba False"". In August 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the tanker's master. Since September 18, 2025, Australia has imposed sanctions on the vessel.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/571""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/48/3a/483a4951e045ade4ee9b4a6721c30555e6f3bbce04d03ff343a84fef29a0b37f-medium.webp"" alt=""ELISE"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> ELISE </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9277747 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> unknown </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Oil Products Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Transporting russian crude oil/oil products in violation of other restrictions</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The tanker during the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and the price cap policy on russian crude oil/petroleum products is involved in the export of russian crude oil/petroleum products to third countries, including the use of deceptive practices (disabling AIS, conducting dark activities in the Gulf of Finland, the russian ports of Novorossiysk and Baltiysk).

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. According to the USA-based human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and has switched to transporting russian oil since December 2022.

Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani is the son of Ali Shamkhani, the Chief Political Advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani uses corruption through his father's political influence at the highest levels of the Iranian regime to build and operate a huge fleet of tankers and container ships. This network transports oil and petroleum products from Iran and russia, as well as other cargoes, to buyers around the world, generating tens of billions of dollars in profits. The Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani network consists of a huge fleet of ships, ship management firms and front companies that launder billions of dollars in profits from global sales of Iranian and Russian crude oil and petroleum products, most often to buyers in China. The network has taken significant steps to disguise its operations and obfuscate its ties to the Shamkhani family, Iran, and russia.

In November 2022, United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) included the tanker in a public list of vessels suspected of involvement in the illegal transportation of Iranian oil. According to Lloyd's List, ІМО 9257137 is linked to anonymous Chinese buyers who spent about $376 million to purchase 13 tankers to carry out risky ship-to-ship transportation of russian oil in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data. Lloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing. The shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.

According to the American human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iranian-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and has switched to transporting russian oil since 2022. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to a 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. The international public organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. On July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel. Since October 30, 2025, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on the tanker.

In May 2022, USA imposed sanctions on Transmorflot LLC and its vessels involved in the transportation of weapons for the russian federation. The vessel is also affiliated with LLC PSB Leasing (TIN 7722581759, related to the sanctioned PJSC Promsvyazbank (TIN 7744000912), a systemically important russian state-owned banking institution that finances the russian defense industry, services significant volumes of state defense contracts for the russian ministry of defense, and provides banking services, including mortgage loans, to the russian military. MG-Flot LLC is associated with the Astrakhan businessman Pashayev Jamaldin Emirmagomedovich, who built his business around the commercial port of Olya in the Astrakhan region. This very place was proposed as a key logistic hub of the international transport corridor ""North-South"", the creation and construction of which was supervised and controlled by former russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov. The key purpose of the transportation corridor was to trade with sanctioned Iran, which could import and export goods along the North-South route. As part of the application of sanctions to PJSC Promsvyazbank, in February 2022, USA imposed sanctions on five vessels (including the ""Baltic Leader"") owned (owned at the time) by PSB Leasing LLC as a subsidiary of PJSC Promsvyazbank. ""Baltic Leader"" while owned by PSB Leasing LLC was arrested by French customs for violation of Decision (EU) 2022/260 of February 23, 2022 on restrictive measures against acts undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The russian Embassy in France actively participated in the release of the vessel from arrest. In 2024, the vessel was first used on the Novorossiysk port ( russia) - Tartus port ( Syria) line, which is the only port in the Mediterranean Sea under russian control. In particular, in February 2024, the vessel made a voyage following the ‘Sparta IV’ (IMO 9743033), which was involved in the transportation of weapons from Syria to Novorossiysk. Also involved in this voyage were the tanker ‘Yaz’ (IMO 9735323) and the roller ship ‘Lady Maria’ (IMO 9220641). The vessel is likely a member of the so-called russian rescue group sent from the russian naval base in the Baltic in December 2024 to evacuate russian troops and equipment from Syria after the fall of the Assad regime. On December 31, 2024, the Portuguese Navy observed a group of russian vessels (including military vessels), including a submarine, passing near the country's coast towards the Mediterranean Sea. According to the Armed Forces of Portugal, the russian vessels included the landing ship Alexander Shabalin, civilian logistics support vessels Baltic Leader, Sparta II and the tanker General Skobelev, while the russian submarine Novorossiysk was moving along the country's economic zone. The second group included the russian amphibious warships Ivan Gren, Aleksandr Otrakovsky, and the civilian vessel Sparta, which passed the Strait of Gibraltar on the evening of December 22, 2024, and entered the Mediterranean Sea, and were supposed to arrive at the Syrian port of Tartus on January 05, 2025, but as of the morning of January 07, 2025, the Sparta is sailing off the coast of Syria, probably awaiting permission to enter the port of Tartus from the new Syrian authorities. The tanker General Skobelev and Sparta II are scheduled to call at Tartus on January 08, 2025.

It is the property of the sanctioned russian maritime shipping company MG-Flot LLC (formerly Transmorflot LLC). In May 2022, USA imposed sanctions on Transmorflot LLC and its vessels involved in the transportation of weapons for the russian federation. The commercial manager of the vessel is a sanctioned russian company, Marine Trans shipping LLC (TIN 3025037914), which also operates the Adler (IMO 9179854), a roll-on/roll-off vessel involved in arms transportation. The vessel is also affiliated with LLC PSB Leasing (TIN 7722581759, related to the sanctioned PJSC Promsvyazbank (TIN 7744000912), a systemically important state-owned banking institution of the russian federation, which finances the russian defense industry, services significant volumes of state defense contracts of the ministry of defense of the russian federation, and provides banking services to the russian military, in particular mortgage loans. MG-Flot LLC is associated with the Astrakhan businessman Pashayev Jamaldin Emirmagomedovich, who built his business around the commercial port of Olya in the Astrakhan region. This very place was proposed as a key logistic hub of the international transport corridor ""North-South"", the creation and construction of which was supervised and controlled by former russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov. The key purpose of the transportation corridor was trade with sanctioned Iran, which could import and export goods via the North-South route. This can thus explain the provision of Iranian oil trade by a fleet of tankers affiliated with a bank controlled by Pyotr Fradkov. As part of the application of sanctions against PJSC Promsvyazbank, in February 2022, USA imposed sanctions on five vessels (including the vessel ""Linda"" (current name ""Inda""), which were owned at the time by PSB Leasing LLC as a subsidiary of PJSC Promsvyazbank. Since September 12, 2025, the United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on the vessel.

A Ukrainian court served the vessel’s captain with a notice of suspicion. The captain made seven port calls at the closed commercial seaports of Sevastopol and Kerch (TOT of Crimea, Ukraine) to load looted Ukrainian grain, periodically disabling the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and entering false course data to indicate alleged voyages to russian ports rather than to the closed ports of TOT of Crimea, Ukraine. The Turkish agricultural company Bek Tarim, the russian company Fast LLC (ООО ""Фаст"", TIN 2376000774), and Petrokhleb-Kuban LLC (ООО ""Петрохлеб-Кубань"", TIN 2310109650) have been involved in the vessel’s grain export activities. The vessel is managed by Kuban Marine Company LLC (ООО ""Кубанская морская компания"", TIN 2310213041), a russian company affiliated with Petrokhleb-Kuban LLC. Kuban Marine Company LLC operates three other vessels engaged in illegal voyages to closed ports of TOT of Crimea, Ukraine. The vessel has also been involved in smuggling ilmenite—while AIS was disabled—for the Crimean Titan (АО ""Крымский титан"") plant, seized in TOT of Crimea, Ukraine, through ship-to-ship (STS) transfers in the Black Sea for delivery to the port of Kerch (TOT of Crimea, Ukraine). The vessel has been in violation of Ukrainian legislation and the so-called ""Crimean sanctions"" since 2015, having made numerous port calls at Kerch (TOT of Crimea, Ukraine) since that year, including for raid transshipments in the Kerch Strait. On November 25, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the vessel.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/320""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/10/51/105178f0eb1c1cda9a8d6732b0516d0f5c9d276b0a74e6a6a79c2077c336a6f6-medium.webp"" alt=""SWORD LION"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> SWORD LION </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9136785 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/tr.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='Turkey'> <span class='ml-2'>Turkey</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> General cargo ship </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Cargo transportation from/to ТОТ of Ukraine</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Theft of Ukrainian grain</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The vessel has been implicated in a grain theft scheme involving the export of stolen Ukrainian grain from the temporarily occupied territory (TOT) of Crimea, Ukraine, to Turkey, by reloading in a russian port grain previously exported from the TOT of Crimea, Ukraine, by the vessel Akubens (IMO 8891364). On 2 July 2023, Sword Lion arrived in the Kerch Strait from Port Karadeniz Ereğli (Turkey) with a draft of 6 metres and remained there until 27 July 2023. It then increased its draft to 9.6 metres and proceeded to the outer anchorage of Port Haifa (Israel). The declared recipient of the agricultural cargo was the Israeli company ADM Industries Centers Ltd (Beit Dagan). According to the company’s official records, Sword Lion delivered a shipment of barley labelled as having European origin — a claim that was false. The vessel arrived at Haifa’s outer anchorage on 3 August 2023 but did not enter the port, likely due to the public disclosure of the grain theft scheme. Between 9 and 10 August 2023, the vessel sailed to the coast of Cyprus and anchored at the outer roads of Port Famagusta, remaining there until 15 August 2023 without entering port, likely for the same reasons. It subsequently proceeded to the anchorage of Port Iskenderun (Turkey), where, after six days at anchor with AIS disabled, it entered the port and discharged the grain at a berth operated by a subsidiary of the russian Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant. In 2025, the vessel calls at ports in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/321""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/ba/db/badba690be36d6543f6b88cb360a07dbdb7b471191fad8c993ceb94ec54cd924-medium.webp"" alt=""SORMOVSKIY-48"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> SORMOVSKIY-48 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 8226428 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/ru.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='russian federation'> <span class='ml-2'>russian federation</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> General cargo ship </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Cargo transportation from/to ТОТ of Ukraine</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Theft of Ukrainian grain</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The vessel has been implicated in grain theft schemes involving the export of Ukrainian grain from the ports of Sevastopol and Kerch (temporarily occupied territory – TOT of Crimea, Ukraine), with its AIS (Automatic Identification System) signal disabled, and in its further export, including to the russian Port Kavkaz for transshipment, the Turkish port of Samsun, and from the temporarily occupied port of Berdiansk in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region.

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. The owner and commercial manager of the tanker since October 01, 2024 is an unknown company YO SHUI MARINE LIMITED, established on September 19, 2024 in Hong Kong. The ISM-manager of the tanker is the Indian company AMSHA MARITIME, which manages another tanker 'LACONIA' (IMO 9257022), affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management. The tanker 'KRISHNA 1' is also affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow fleet', which has become the largest carrier of russian oil under sanctions since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of ""juggling"" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. Almost all vessels that are involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.). The 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The recent incidents off Malaysia only underscore the need for swift action to curb the potentially devastating impact of the growing 'shadow fleet'. 'Shadow' tankers have already been involved in 50 incidents from the Danish Straits all the way to Malaysia since russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to CREA, from January to August 2024, the number of shadow tankers crossing the Danish Straits in Europe increased by 277% compared to the same period in 2022, with 64% of the 46 million tons of russian marine oil transported through the Danish Straits being transported by shadow tankers. In the same period, the number of shadow tankers in the Straits of Dover and Gibraltar increased by 355% compared to 2022, transporting 67% of the 37 million tons of oil through the straits. The Suez Canal experienced a staggering 649% increase in shadow tanker traffic, with 69% of the 52 million tons of russian crude oil passing through it being transported by these vessels. Thus, the 'shadow fleet' of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33); in relation to contributing to, supporting actions or policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure. On December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33); in relation to contributing to, supporting actions or policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.

In particular, in July 2023, the vessel exported russian oil/oil products from the russian port of Kavkaz in the Black Sea to the EU countries (to the Laconikos Gulf, Greece) through a transshipment in violation of the embargo. RLRISE Moldova, a community of investigative journalists, programmers and activists from the Republic of Moldova and Romania, and the international NGO Greenpeace refer to the tanker as a shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. Under the sanctions, russia has begun to build up its own shadow fleet of outdated tankers, which has no 'ties' with the G7 and the EU and can transport oil in violation of price caps. russia disguises its shadow activities at sea under the 'convenient' flags of third countries, operates at sea without proper insurance from the international club of insurers, uses complex schemes to conceal the owners of the shadow fleet, uses various deceptive tactics to conceal the origin of its cargo, creates threats to environmental safety with large-scale economic costs for coastal countries due to the growing threat of oil spills, does not use pilots to navigate difficult areas, etc. russia's 'shadow fleet' continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On May 20, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

The vessel took russian crude oil from the russian port of Ust-Luga in the Baltic Sea in September 2024 and delivered it to a transshipment point south of Lacon Bay, west of the island of Kithira. According to United Against Nuclear Iran, the vessel is suspected of transporting Iranian oil. According to an internal analysis prepared by the Scottish Coastguard satellite services, the tanker was involved in a spill of russian oil in the sea about 100 km off the Scottish coastline. At the time, the vessel was carrying 1 million barrels of sanctioned oil from russia on its way to a refinery in India. The shadow fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with the automatic identification system turned off, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The shadow fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the russian federation bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.

The major charterers of PJSC Sovcomflot's vessels are russia's largest oil and gas companies and traders. PJSC Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: Sakhalin-1, Sakhalin-2, Varandey, Prirazlomnoye, Novy Port, Yamal LNG and others. After the sanctions were imposed, PJSC Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to expert estimates, the tankers 're-registered' by PJSC Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian crude oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas under Western sanctions. The previous owner of the tanker ІМО 9256066 is the sanctioned Progress shipping company Limited (UAE), affiliated with PJSC Sovcomflot. The change of the tanker's owner and manager to a russian shipping company took place after sanctions were imposed on Progress shipping company Limited (UAE). In November 2023, USA imposed sanctions on three vessels (including ІМО 9256066) affiliated with the sanctioned company PJSC Sovcomflot, which were involved in the export of russian crude oil at a price of more than $60 per barrel after the price-cap policy for russian oil came into force.

The tanker was involved in the sale of russian crude oil at a price of more than $80 after the price-cap policy came into effect. The vessel through the russian company Invest Fleet LLC is affiliated with the sanctioned PJSC Sovcomflot, the largest state-owned shipping company in russia that services and supports offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian crude oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas. The major charterers of PJSC Sovcomflot's vessels are russia's largest oil and gas companies and traders. PJSC Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: Sakhalin-1, Sakhalin-2, Varandey, Prirazlomnoye, Novy Port, Yamal LNG and others. After the sanctions were imposed, PJSC Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to expert estimates, the tankers 're-registered' by PJSC Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian crude oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas under Western sanctions. In February 2024, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel",9339301,,,,

Orion Ship Management was the previous manager of the tanker. Within the framework of restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker on February 24, 2025. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

Transshipment of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin by STS method at sea allows concealing the ownership and origin of the cargo, legalizing their supply to the EU, USA and other countries. In turn, the sale of crude oil/petroleum products on the world market allows accumulating significant financial resources in the state budget of the russian federation, which are used, among other things, to build up the military potential of the aggressor state and to provide material support for russia's military operations on the territory of Ukraine. The tanker engages in dark activities in the Kerch Strait area, near russian ports in the Black Sea, and makes calls, in particular, to the Sheskharis terminal (Novorossiysk), which is a transshipment complex, the end point of the main pipelines of Chernomortransneft JSC (TIN: 2315072242, under USA sanctions), a subsidiary of the sanctioned russian PJSC Transneft (TIN: 7706061801), the port of Tuapse, where the production complex belonging to the sanctioned PJSC Rosneft Oil Company - Tuapse Oil Refinery with a sea terminal, and to the Taman crude oil/petroleum products transshipment complex. In August and September 2023, the tanker was involved in the export of several batches of petroleum products (over 120 thousand tons in total) (ordered by Tüpras Türkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A.Ş., Tejarinaft FZCO) from the russian port of Tuapse, the shipper of the cargoes was the sanctioned russian Rosneft (three batches), Amur Trading FZCO (one batch).

The international non-governmental organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. According to the USA-based human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and switched to transporting russian oil in July 2023. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 100 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to the 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. Shadow fleet of russia continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world through the Baltic Sea, the Kadetsky Canal area in the Bay of Mecklenburg, and threatening the environment. According to the American human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iranian-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and switched to transporting russian oil in March 2023. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to the ""ghost armada"" to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. The tanker was included by UANI in the list of Maduro-Khamenei Oil Alliance tankers involved in the transportation of Iranian and Venezuelan oil. On June 11, 2022, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi signed a 20-year cooperation agreement to expand ties in the oil and petrochemical industries, military and economic spheres. Since then, bilateral ties have been developing: in 2023, Iran supplied more than 12 million barrels of crude oil and gas condensate, and Venezuela supplied about the same amount of fuel oil to Iran in return. Most of the cargo is transported by vessels of the sanctioned National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) in both directions: Iranian oil and gas are unloaded in Venezuelan ports, and the same NITC tankers load Venezuelan fuel oil on the way back to China. A significant number of non-NITC vessels flying foreign (not Iranian) flags are also involved in the trade. On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.

On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.

In particular, the vessel is involved in STS transfers of russian oil to the vessel LIGERA in the Laconikos Gulf (Greece). According to Kpler, on January 09, 2024, the LIGERA was recorded by the MarineTraffic ship spotter off the coast of Crete in ballast with a draft of 11.3 m. On January 10, 2024, the tanker sailed to the Laconian Gulf, where it made an STS transfer on the same day, receiving URALS oil from the NAUTILUS (IMO 9434890). According to Kpler, NAUTILUS was loaded with 729 thousand barrels of Urals oil from the port of Ust-Luga. The LIGERA, loaded with russian oil, concealed information about the change in the ship's draft and headed to Venezuela, where an STS transfer of oil to the MORNING SUN (IMO 9110183) was detected between February 28 and March 1, 2024, which delivered 600 thousand barrels of russian oil to the Cardon refinery in Venezuela on March 02, 2024. The tanker is affiliated with Adel Ship Management SRL (Moldova), which manages tankers that help russia transport crude oil under western sanctions. Adel Ship Management SRL is considered one of the largest carriers of russian crude oil, in particular, in the first half of 2024, the Moldovan company shipped 2.6 million barrels of oil, which is approximately 2% of total russian exports. RLRISE Moldova, a community of investigative journalists, programmers, and activists from the Republic of Moldova and Romania, attributes the tanker to the shadow fleet involved in russian oil exports. On May 20, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. From July 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions on a tanker for transporting crude oil/petroleum products that originate in russia or are exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33).

The vessel is certified by the Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Galena Ship Management, which is affiliated with Gatik, which in 2023, together with Gaurik Ship Management LLP, Caishan Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management LLP, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Galena Ship Management were the previous managers of the tanker. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. Almost all vessels that are involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.). The 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. On February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel. On April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel",9378620,,,,

The tanker is linked to sanctioned companies Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE), Wanta Shipping LLC-FZ (UAE), etc., which managed the vessel in 2022-2024. Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE) is considered one of the leading operators of the shadow fleet, which in early 2023 was among the three largest carriers of Russian oil, along with Radiating World Shipping Services LLC (UAE) and Gatik Ship Management (India), and played a significant role in the export of russian oil to countries around the world during the period of sanctions restrictions. Fractal Marine DMCC managed a fleet of 28 tankers as an intermediary between shipowners and charterers. Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE) and Wanta Shipping LLC-FZ (UAE) are part of a shipping empire controlled by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkhani, the chief political advisor to Iran's supreme leader. Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani uses his father's political influence to corrupt top-level officials in the Iranian regime in order to build and operate a huge fleet of tankers and container ships. This fleet transports oil and petroleum products from Iran and Russia, as well as other cargoes, to buyers around the world, generating tens of billions of dollars in profits. Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani's shipping empire consists of a vast fleet of vessels, ship management companies, and front companies that launder billions of dollars in profits from the global sale of Iranian and Russian crude oil and petroleum products, mostly to buyers in China. The shipping empire takes significant measures to conceal its operations and obscure its ties to the Shamkhani family, Iran, and Russia. Fractal Marine DMCC has played an important role in the management and operation of the tanker and container ship fleet of Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani's shipping network. Wanta Shipping LLC-FZ (UAE) performs the operational functions of Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani's shipping network fleet.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/811""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/92/9c/929ce62c6feaace2557790289b16d6e7a104e67499a56bebe49c6d087dd34ee7-medium.webp"" alt=""PM BACTON"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> PM BACTON </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9264283 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/sl.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='Sierra Leone'> <span class='ml-2'>Sierra Leone</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Chemical/Oil Products Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Transporting russian crude oil/oil products in violation of other restrictions</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The tanker, during the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and the price cap policy on russian crude oil/petroleum products, is actively involved in the export of russian crude oil/petroleum products from russian ports, in particular from the port of Novorossiysk to Libya, as well as to other countries through STS transmissions, including with the AIS signal turned off in the Kerch Strait, russian ports in the Black Sea, and near Romania.

The Shamkhani-controlled shipping network comprises a large fleet of vessels, ship-management companies, and front (shell) companies used to launder billions of dollars in proceeds from global sales of Iranian and russian crude oil and petroleum products, predominantly to buyers in the People’s Republic of China. The network undertakes extensive measures to conceal its operations and to obscure links to the Shamkhani family, Iran, and russia. On 30 July 2025, the United States designated the vessel",9228538,,,,

The vessel, through related companies, including Fornax Ship Management, the sanctioned Sun Ship Management, Oil Tankers SCF MGMT FZCO affiliated with the sanctioned PJSC Sovcomflot, the largest state-owned shipping company in russia, a key company for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, petroleum products, liquefied natural gas amidst the application of sanctions restrictions to the russian federation after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The services provided by Sovcomflot are a significant source of income for russia, as more than 70% of russia's revenues come from the sale of energy, which allows it to finance its war against Ukraine. The main charterers of Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', 'Sakhalin-2', 'Varandey', 'Prirazlomnoye', 'Novy Port', 'Yamal LNG' and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to expert estimates, the tankers 'transferred' by Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas under western sanctions. On December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the vessel (effective December 17, 2024). On December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel.

In February, October 2023, and January 2024, the tanker was involved in the export of several consignments of petroleum products (over 100 thousand tons in total) (ordered by Tejarinaft FZCO, Voliton DMCC) from the russian port of Tuapse, where the production complex belonging to the sanctioned PJSC Rosneft Oil Company, the Tuapse Refinery with a sea terminal, is located. The shippers of the cargoes were the sanctioned russian Rosneft (two consignments) and Amur Trading FZCO (one consignment). Voliton DMCC (UAE, formerly known as Petrokim Trading Middle East & Asia DMCC) was subject to USA sanctions as part of restrictions against shipowners and vessels involved in the transportation of russian crude oil in excess of the price cap. Voliton DMCC and Guron Trading Limited are believed to be affiliated with Etibar Eyub, who, together with other associated companies, has become the main intermediary of Rosneft in the export of russian crude oil/petroleum products. The tanker has been involved in numerous STS transfers in the Kerch Strait, Greece. In March 2023, in the area south of the Kerch Strait, tanker",9258014,,,,

Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani–the son of Ali Shamkhani, the chief political adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader–has leveraged his father’s political influence to corrupt senior officials of the Iranian regime and to build and operate an extensive fleet of tankers and container vessels. This fleet transports crude oil and refined petroleum products originating from Iran and the russian federation, as well as other cargoes, to customers worldwide, generating revenues in the tens of billions of dollars. The Shamkhani-controlled shipping network comprises a large fleet of vessels, ship-management companies, and front (shell) companies that launder billions of dollars in proceeds from the global sale of crude oil and petroleum products from Iran and the russian federation, predominantly to buyers in the People’s Republic of China. The network undertakes extensive measures to conceal its operations and to obscure links to the Shamkhani family, Iran, and the russian federation. Marvise SMC DMCC covertly controls a fleet of dozens of vessels titled to numerous other companies that transport crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from Iran.

Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Ali Shamkhani – chief political advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran – leverages his father’s political influence to cultivate corruption among senior Iranian officials, enabling the construction and operation of a vast fleet of tankers and container ships.

In particular, on August 3, 2025, the tanker left the Sheshkharis terminal (port of Novorossiysk) loaded with crude oil (almost 140,000 metric tons) and delivered the cargo to India. The sender of the cargo was the sanctioned company PJSC Rosneft Oil Company. The ship sails under the flag of Panama, which is on the gray list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control. The tanker is owned by Konya Shipping SA (Panama, Panama Folio No. 155749740). The founder of Konya Shipping S.A. is Hector Varela De Leon. On July 30, 2025, the USA imposed sanctions on Hector Varela De Leon for his activities in the oil sector of the Iranian economy. Hector Varela De Leon is associated with the incorporation and management of shell companies that are part of a vast shipping empire controlled by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Ali Shamkhani, chief political advisor to Iran's supreme leader. Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani's shipping empire consists of a huge fleet of ships, ship management companies, and front companies that launder billions of dollars in profits from the global sale of Iranian and russian crude oil and petroleum products, mostly to buyers in China. The international non-governmental organization Greenpeace classifies the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment.

The tanker was transporting russian crude oil at a price of over $75 after the price-cap policy came into effect. The owner and manager of the tanker is the russian company South Fleet LLC, the previous owner was the sanctioned company Lumber Marine SA, affiliated with the sanctioned PJSC Sovcomflot, he largest state-owned shipping company in russia that services and supports offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian crude oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas. The major charterers of PJSC Sovcomflot's vessels are russia's largest oil and gas companies and traders. PJSC Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: Sakhalin-1, Sakhalin-2, Varandey, Prirazlomnoye, Novy Port, Yamal LNG and others. After the sanctions were imposed, PJSC Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to expert estimates, the tankers 're-registered' by PJSC Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian crude oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas under Western sanctions. In October 2023, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel ІМО 9421960 for violating the price-cap policy. On February 24, 2025, EU imposed sanctions on a tanker associated with a sanctioned person (the sanctions come into force on February 25, 2025). On March 04, 2025, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the tanker as a vessel associated with a sanctioned entity. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.

For the first time, the tanker was recorded as a violator of the Crimean sanctions on May 12, 2017. The vessel delivered 6,500 tons of diesel fuel from Novorossiysk to the Feodosia oil depot (at that time, the Kerch Bridge did not yet exist, and fuel was delivered to the temporarily occupied Crimean peninsula by sea). At least 21 such deliveries were recorded before the Kerch Bridge was put into operation (May 2018). The vast majority of deliveries to the temporarily occupied Feodosia were made with a disabled AIS signal, while the ship officially reported that its destination port was the port of Kavkaz (russian federation). The tanker is involved in the supply of petroleum products to the Syrian group of russian troops in the interests of the russian ministry of defense. The vessel regularly delivered gasoline and diesel fuel from the Feodosia oil depot to the Syrian port of Tartus for the purpose of supplying russian troops in Syria, including the russian Navy's ""Syrian squadron."" The tanker usually turned off its AIS in the Mediterranean Sea as it approached Cyprus, then continued to Tartus with its AIS signal turned off. The ship was used to supply fuel to russian troops in syria after sanctions were imposed on JSC Sovfracht, which manages the tanker. JSC Sovfracht is one of russia's largest transport and forwarding companies and plays a key role in the military transport network of russian cargo ships that deliver North Korean weapons to military facilities, which are then transported to weapons depots on russia's western border for use in the war against Ukraine. In September 2019, USA imposed sanctions on the tanker for providing material support to the sanctioned JSC Sovfracht. On August 4, 2023, the tanker was holed after an attack in the Black Sea south of the Kerch Strait. In June 2025, the ship was involved in transportation between russia and Iran via the Caspian Sea. In June 2025, the ship sailed from the port of Astrakhan to the port of Amirabad.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/253""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/61/67/61675bc50d72bdd01022c342b7fd3630647dfec44dd2c840463fa858545f4bfd-medium.webp"" alt=""SUDAK"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> SUDAK </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 8943155 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/ru.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='russian federation'> <span class='ml-2'>russian federation</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Oil Products Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Associated with sanctioned entities</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The vessel is part of the fleet of the sanctioned russian shipping company Transpetrochart LLC (ООО ""Транспетроchart""), which has been implicated in providing material support to the sanctioned JSC Sovfracht (АО ""Совфрахт"") – one of the largest independent transport and forwarding companies in russia, serving as a key node in the military transport network of russian cargo vessels delivering North Korean weapons to military facilities, which are then moved to weapons warehouses on russia’s western border for use in the war against Ukraine.

Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to a 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. The vessel resorts to deceptive practices, including manipulation of the vessel's location and dark activities near Malaysia. On April 04, 2024, the USA imposed sanctions on the tanker ІМО 9281683, affiliated with OCEANLINK MARITIME DMCC and involved in cooperation with the sanctioned Iranian company Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars Company in the delivery of Iranian goods. Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars Company controls a network of front companies in Iran and other jurisdictions through which Iranian goods are sold in favor of the Ministry of Defense and Logistics of the Armed Forces of Iran (MODAFL) and the Iranian Armed Forces General Staff (AFGS). On December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular and risky shipping practices, as set out in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33).

According to the American human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors tanker traffic related to Iran using satellite data, the vessel is involved in the transportation of Iranian crude oil and/or oil products, and since May 2023 has been included in the 'Armada of Ghosts' list maintained by UANI. The tanker BERTHA has also been included by UANI in the list of Maduro-Khamenei Oil Alliance tankers involved in the transportation of Iranian and Venezuelan oil since 2019. On June 11, 2022, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi signed a 20-year cooperation agreement to expand ties in the oil and petrochemical industries, military and economic spheres. Since then, bilateral ties have been developing: in 2023, Iran supplied more than 12 million barrels of crude oil and gas condensate, and Venezuela supplied about the same amount of fuel oil to Iran in return. Most of the cargo is transported by vessels of the sanctioned National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) in both directions: Iranian oil and gas are unloaded in Venezuelan ports, and the same NITC tankers load Venezuelan fuel oil on the way back to China. However, a significant number of non-NITC vessels flying a foreign (non-Iranian) flag are also involved in the trade. The vessel is affiliated with the Chinese company Shanghai Legendary Ship Management Company Limited (under USA sanctions), whose fleet has been involved in the illegal transportation of millions of barrels of Iranian oil since at least 2022.

Iran relies on an extensive network of tankers and ship management companies in multiple jurisdictions to transport its oil to foreign customers, using deceptive tactics such as falsifying documentation, manipulating ship tracking systems, and constantly changing ship names and flags. One of the most commonly used tactics to evade oil sanctions is 'flag hopping' in various national registries, which allows the vessel to carry out transportation and have the right to moor. This tactic is often accompanied by the creation of fictitious companies, change of owners, managers, ship names, and change of physical markings of the vessel. Some shipowners deliberately use flag registries to evade sanctions, many of which do not have the resources and capabilities to track and verify the history of their vessels. The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Tightship Shipping Management (OPC) Private Limited, whose fleet (including the tanker ІМО 9285756) is involved in the transportation of Iranian oil worth tens of millions of dollars for the sanctioned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at least since 2022. The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world and is controlled by the Iranian Ministry of Oil.

In particular, in January 2024, near Singapore, CERES I transferred almost 300,000 metric tons of Iranian oil from ship to ship in the interests of the sanctioned Jazira Das International Products Trading LLC (UAE), China Concord Petroleum Company (CCPC) and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world and is controlled by the Iranian Ministry of Oil. NIOC and its subsidiaries explore, produce, transport, process and export oil and natural gas in Iran. NIOC's oil deals, including those of its subsidiaries, are used to generate revenue for the IRGC-QF (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) and Hizballah. Jazira Das International Products Trading LLC is a UAE-registered company involved in falsifying documents to 'disguise' barrels of Iranian oil from the sanctioned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) as Emirati oil, coordinating many NIOC oil shipments to the sanctioned China Concord Petroleum Company to transport millions of barrels of oil, and concealing NIOC's involvement in the supply. According to the American human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel is involved in the transportation of Iranian crude oil and/or petroleum products and has been included in the UANI's 'Ghost Armada' list since April 2021. Also, the tanker CERES I was included by UANI in the list of tankers of the Maduro-Khamenei Oil Alliance involved in the transportation of Iranian and Venezuelan oil. On June 11, 2022, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi signed a 20-year cooperation agreement to expand ties in the oil and petrochemical industries, military and economic spheres. Since then, bilateral ties have been developing: in 2023, Iran supplied more than 12 million barrels of crude oil and gas condensate, and Venezuela supplied about the same amount of fuel oil to Iran in return. Most of the cargo is transported by vessels of the sanctioned National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) in both directions: Iranian oil and gas are unloaded in Venezuelan ports, and the same NITC tankers load Venezuelan fuel oil on the way back to China. A significant number of non-NITC vessels flying foreign (non-Iranian) flags are also involved in the trade. Also, according to UANI, the CERES I tanker is one of 16 oil tankers that have switched from Iranian oil to russian oil as of July 2022. In July 2024, the CERES I tanker was involved in a collision with another oil tanker, causing an oil spill in international waters near Malaysia. During the collision, the CERES I's tracking signals did not correspond to its position, which prevented it from communicating with the other vessel.

Iran relies on an extensive network of tankers and ship management companies in multiple jurisdictions to transport its oil to foreign customers, using deceptive tactics such as falsifying documentation, manipulating ship tracking systems, and constantly changing ship names and flags. One of the most commonly used tactics to evade oil sanctions is 'flag hopping' in various national registries, which allows the vessel to carry out transportation and have the right to moor. This tactic is often accompanied by the creation of fictitious companies, change of owners, managers, ship names, and change of physical markings of the vessel.

In particular, in August 2024, the vessel transported russian oil from the port of Tuapse ( russia) to the EU countries to the area south of the Laconian gulf, west of the island of Kithira. The vessel is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The international public organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the Gatik-related company Gaurik Ship Management LLP, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management LLP, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels managed by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Gaurik Ship Management LLP were the previous managers of the tanker 'GOLDEN MILE'. Tankers operated/managed by the Indian Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. Against the backdrop of sanctions, russia is using a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to conceal the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. Almost all vessels involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.). The 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The recent incidents off Malaysia only underscore the need for swift action to curb the potentially devastating impact of the growing 'shadow fleet'. 'Shadow' tankers have already been involved in 50 incidents from the Danish Straits all the way to Malaysia since russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to CREA, from January to August 2024, the number of shadow tankers crossing the Danish Straits in Europe increased by 277% compared to the same period in 2022, with 64% of the 46 million tons of russian marine oil transported through the Danish Straits being transported by shadow tankers. In the same period, the number of shadow tankers in the Straits of Dover and Gibraltar increased by 355% compared to 2022, transporting 67% of the 37 million tons of oil through the straits. The Suez Canal experienced a staggering 649% increase in shadow tanker traffic, with 69% of the 52 million tons of russian crude oil passing through it being transported by these vessels. Thus, the 'shadow fleet' of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel. On April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel",9337901,,,,

The tanker is affiliated with Adel Ship Management SRL (Moldova), which manages tankers that help russia transport crude oil under Western sanctions. Adel Ship Management SRL is considered one of the largest carriers of russian crude oil, in particular, in the first half of 2024, the Moldovan company shipped 2.6 million barrels of oil, which is approximately 2% of total russian exports. Thus, the company is among the top ten russian crude oil carriers, along with operators from Greece, the UAE and China. RLRISE Moldova, a community of investigative journalists, programmers and activists from the Republic of Moldova and Romania, refers to the tanker as a shadow fleet involved in russian oil exports. To avoid sanctions, russia's 'shadow fleet' uses 'convenient' flags for tankers and complex ownership and management structures, employing a variety of tactics to conceal the origin of its cargo, including: ship-to-ship transfers, disabling automatic identification systems, falsifying positions, transmitting false data, and other deceptive or even illegal methods. In addition to bolstering military capabilities, russia's 'shadow fleet', consisting of a growing number of outdated and poorly maintained vessels operating with minimal compliance with regulations, poses significant risks to the environment, maritime safety and navigation security. The shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.

The vessel calls at ports in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, in particular in June 2025 at the port of Kamysh-Burun, and in July 2025 at the ports of Kerch and Kamysh-Burun. According to the United Against Nuclear Iran, the tanker is involved in the transportation of Iranian oil, and after the start of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has been helping russia to transport russian crude oil/petroleum products. The tanker is included in the list of ""The Maduro-Khamenei Oil Alliance: List of Foreign Flagged Vessels Shipping Iranian and Venezuelan Oil"" compiled by the United Against Nuclear Iran. According to UANI, the vessel is one of the tankers that do not belong to the sanctioned National Iranian Tanker Company, sail under foreign flags (not the flag of Iran) and participate in Iranian-Venezuelan trade, which has been actively developing since Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi signed a 20-year cooperation agreement in June 2022 to expand ties in the oil and petrochemical industries, military and economic spheres. Under this agreement, Iran supplies Venezuela with crude oil and gas condensate, and Venezuela supplies Iran with fuel oil. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.

In July 2025, the tanker transported nearly 100,000 tons of russian oil from the Sheskharis terminal in the port of Novorossiysk to India. The shipper of the liquid cargo was the russian company PJSC Lukoil, which is subject to sanctions, and the charterer was Litasco.

On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

The vessel is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Orion Ship Management LLP, which is related to Gatik, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Gaurik Ship Management LLP, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Orion Ship Management were the previous managers of the vessel. Tankers operated/managed by the Indian Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. Against the backdrop of sanctions, russia is using a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to conceal the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of outdated oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. Almost all vessels involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS) since 2022. The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.). The 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33); promoting or supporting actions/policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025).

In particular, the vessel made a port call at the closed port of Sevastopol on 4– 5 July 2022 with AIS switched on, confirming its violation of Ukraine’s state border. Between 17– 20 July 2022, the vessel’s AIS was disabled; during this period, it called at the port of Sevastopol and loaded 3,000 tonnes of barley at the grain terminal in Dokova Bay (owned by Avlita and controlled by the United Shipbuilding Corporation (Объединённая судостроительная корпорация, USC)). On 19 July 2022, the vessel departed Sevastopol Bay and proceeded to conduct STS operations in the Kerch Strait. On 20 July 2022, AIS was enabled again. Evidence confirming port calls at the TOT of Crimea, Ukraine was recorded by the vessel’s master and published on a social media platform. The Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine served the vessel’s master with a notice of suspicion for violating the procedure for entering and leaving the temporarily occupied territory.

In December 2022, the United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) included the tanker in a public list of vessels suspected of involvement in the illegal transportation of Iranian oil. russia has created its own shadow fleet of tankers, mostly made up of old tankers, many of which have experience in operating under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 100 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian oil are now helping russia transport russian crude oil/petroleum products. In May 2022, UANI predicted that russia would use a ""ghost armada"" to ensure the flow of excess profits from oil exports, in particular to its Chinese partner. Since December 2024, the owner and commercial manager of the tanker is Nissho Lines Inc, registered in the Marshall Islands (Trust Company Complex, Ajeltake Road, Ajeltake, Majuro MH 96960, Marshall Islands), which is widely used for registration of companies that own/manage shadow fleet tankers. The shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the Kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On May 08, 2025, USA imposes sanctions on the tanker for carrying out numerous shipments of Iranian oil products via STS to the Persian Gulf, as well as for being owned by Nissho Lines Incorporated, a sanctioned company involved in the oil sector of the Iranian economy. On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the russian government, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular from russia to a third country. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. Since September 18, 2025, Australia has imposed sanctions on the vessel. Since October 30, 2025, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on the tanker.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/549""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/17/b2/17b2b65f8f39690e42f203f58d9fa2abdbef2bbd58b2553a39b89f13677e73d3-medium.webp"" alt=""YODAN"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> YODAN </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9304356 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/vu.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='Vanuatu'> <span class='ml-2'>Vanuatu</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Crude Oil Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Transporting russian crude oil/oil products in violation of other restrictions</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The tanker is involved in the export of russian crude oil / petroleum products during the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and price-cap policy on russian crude oil / petroleum products, and resorts to the practice of turning off the AIS signal and conducting dark activities at sea. The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. According to United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel participated in numerous STS operations with Iranian oil in 2021, and since September 2021, the ship has switched to transporting russian oil. Since May 21, 2025, the EU has imposed sanctions on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil / petroleum products originating from russia or exported from russia using irregular high-risk shipping practices, as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. On June 17, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil / petroleum products of russian origin from russia to third countries. Since June 2025, the vessel has been owned by Backstreet Palm Corp (Seychelles), which was subject to USA sanctions on July 30, 2025. Backstreet Palm Corp is part of a network of companies controlled by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Ali Shamkhani, the Chief Political Advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani uses corruption through his father's political influence at the highest levels of the Iranian regime to build and operate a huge fleet of tankers and container ships. This network transports oil and petroleum products from Iran and russia, as well as other cargoes, to buyers around the world, generating tens of billions of dollars in profits. The Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani network consists of a huge fleet of ships, ship management firms and front companies that launder billions of dollars in profits from global sales of Iranian and russian crude oil and petroleum products, mostly to buyers in China. The network takes significant steps to disguise its operations and obfuscate its ties to the Shamkhani family, Iran, and russia. On July 30, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the tanker",9304356,,,,

In mid-September 2022, the Syrian-flagged vessel was among the first to export 2,500 tons of Ukrainian grain to Turkey, loaded at the port of temporarily occupied Berdiansk. The vessel regularly calls at ports in the TOT of Ukraine (Sevastopol, Komysh-Burun), delivering construction mixtures from Turkey. It is also engaged in ilmenite shipments, transporting raw materials from the Turkish port of Ambarli to the Crimean Titan titanium plant, which was seized by russia.

The tanker is managed by Prominent Shipmanagement LTD, established in 2022 in Hong Kong. Prominent is headed by Arjun Deshmukh, who worked for FESCO Wallem Shipmanagement, a joint venture between a russian company and Hong Kong's oldest ship manager. Prominent Shipmanagement LTD took over all tankers operated by K&O Shipmanagement FZE, a Dubai-based company affiliated with the sanctioned russian company Sovcomflot, and the vessels were included in the Indian Register of Shipping (the classification society with the largest market share of the so-called shadow fleet). PJSC Sovcomflot is the largest state-owned shipping company in russia for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas. The main charterers of Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. Under the sanctions, russia has begun to build up its own shadow fleet of outdated tankers, which has no 'ties' with the G7 and the EU and can transport oil in violation of price caps. russia disguises its shadow activities at sea under the 'convenient' flags of third countries, operates at sea without proper insurance from the international club of insurers, uses complex schemes to conceal the owners of the shadow fleet, uses various deceptive tactics to conceal the origin of its cargo, creates threats to environmental safety with large-scale economic costs for coastal countries due to the growing threat of oil spills, does not use pilots to navigate difficult areas, etc. The shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. On April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel",9436006,,,,

In violation of the oil embargo, the vessel transported russian crude oil from the port of St. Petersburg in the Baltic Sea to the Laconikos Gulf, Greece, in April 2024. According to the USA-based human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and switched to transporting russian oil in December 2020. Oil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the regime of the aggressor country to finance the war against Ukraine. From February 2022 to November 22, 2024, russia earned almost 546 billion euros in oil export revenues (69% of all fossil fuel export revenues). In 2023, about a third of all tax revenues in russia came from the sale of oil and gas. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to the CREA data for October 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 210 million euros per day, 83% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 17% of the total value of russian oil exported in October. Shadow fleet of russia continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/570""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/7a/49/7a49256d0e2e67bb2eff5579a84f5e591db2414456f90e0db3e25618f1dbbdf2-medium.webp"" alt=""SOUFIA 1"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> SOUFIA 1 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9273052 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> unknown </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Crude Oil Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Violation of the oil embargo</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">The tanker is involved in the export of russian oil, violating the G7, EU oil embargo on russian oil in March 2024.

In particular, in May 2024, the vessel was transporting russian crude oil from the port of Primorsk in the Baltic Sea to the place of oil transfer near the port of Nador (Morocco) and the Spanish port of Melilla. According to the USA-based human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and switched to transporting russian oil on August 31, 2023. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to a 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. The international public organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. Oil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the regime of the aggressor country to finance the war against Ukraine. From February 2022 to November 22, 2024, russia earned almost 546 billion euros in oil export revenues (69% of all fossil fuel export revenues). In 2023, about a third of all tax revenues in russia came from the sale of oil and gas. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to the CREA data for October 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 210 million euros per day, 83% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 17% of the total value of russian oil exported in October. Shadow fleet of russia continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On May 20, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment. The vessel, through its related companies, including sanctioned Sun Ship Management, SCF Management Services Cyprus, is affiliated with the sanctioned PJSC Sovcomflot, the largest state-owned shipping company in russia for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas. The main charterers of PJSC Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. PJSC Sovcomflot is involved in servicing large oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', 'Sakhalin-2', 'Varandey', 'Prirazlomnoye', 'Novy Port', 'Yamal LNG' and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, in order to circumvent them, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it created, including in foreign jurisdictions, and started the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to experts, the tankers 're-registered' by Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas under Western sanctions. russia's 'shadow fleet' continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On November 25, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a tanker in connection with the transportation of russian oil/oil products from the russian federation to a third country as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. From July 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions on a tanker for transporting crude oil/petroleum products that originate in russia or are exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33). On August 12, 2025, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel.

According to the American human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and switched to transporting russian oil in June 2023. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to a 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel.

At that time, the fleet of Fractal Marine Shipping, Radiating World Shipping Services and Gatik Ship Management comprised about 90 tankers, 90% of which transported oil and oil products from the Baltic and Black Sea ports of russia to India, China, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and South America. In December 2023, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Radiating World Shipping Services LLC (UAE), which is transferring its tankers to other newly established related companies to avoid sanctions.

On 17 October 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on tankers of the russian so-called ‘shadow’ fleet, including the tanker ІМО 9299898, in connection with the transportation of russian oil and/or oil products from the russian federation to third countries. On December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33); in relation to contributing to, supporting actions or policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure.

The tanker is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The vessel through related companies, in particular sanctioned Oil Tankers SCF MGMT FZCO, Sun Ship Management, SCF Management Services LTD, is affiliated with the sanctioned PJSC Sovcomflot, the largest state-owned shipping company in russia, a key company for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, oil products, and liquefied natural gas amid sanctions restrictions on russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The services provided by Sovcomflot are a significant source of income for russia, as more than 70% of russia's revenues come from energy sales, which allows it to finance its war against Ukraine. The main charterers of Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', 'Sakhalin-2', 'Varandey', 'Prirazlomnoye', 'Novy Port', 'Yamal LNG' and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly ""juggling"" (transferring) vessels to related companies. From December 17, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the vessel (sanctions were amended on July 18, 2025). On December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel.

In particular, in March 2023, a tanker transported russian oil from the russian port of Taman to the EU countries (Laconikos Gulf, Greece). The international non-governmental organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. The tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Galena Ship Management, which is affiliated with Gatik, which in 2023, together with Gaurik Ship Management LLP, Caishan Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management LLP, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Galena Ship Management were the previous managers of the tanker. Tankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. As sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of ""juggling"" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under ""convenient flags"", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies. On December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.

The Lauren II transports crude oil loaded by other tankers from ship to ship from the russian port of Primorsk in the Baltic Sea. In particular, the Lauren II was tracked while loading a cargo of crude oil by means of a ship-to-ship transfer from the tanker Zhen I (IMO 9255880). The VLCC tanker was purchased from DHT Tankers and is affiliated with an anonymous Chinese buyer who spent about $376 million to acquire a group of 13 tankers for the high-risk transportation of russian-origin crude oil in the Atlantic Ocean. These 13 tankers include five Aframax vessels, seven very large crude oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel. According to Lloyd's List Intelligence, these vessels were purchased by an anonymous buyer through 20 separate but interconnected single-ship offshore companies from Hong Kong and China. Subsequently, all but one of the tankers were engaged in transshipment of cargoes in the established high-risk transshipment hub for russian crude oil for consolidation of cargoes in the area 860 nautical miles west of Portugal, in international waters. The registered owners, commercial managers, and ISM manager are characterized by an almost identical registration address in Dalian (PRC), and the same two addresses in Hong Kong. This group of tankers is considered to be the center of a fully operational mid-Atlantic transshipment hub for russian crude oil to China. Logistics STS hubs allow to conceal the ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the Mid-Atlantic hub, transshipment centers include areas near Kalamata, Greece, Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus, where STS operations for russian crude oil have been established. The tanker, believed to be part of the shadow fleet, is affiliated with SUNNE CO LIMITED, which was sanctioned by USA on January 10, 2025 for its activities in the energy sector of the russian federation.

The last change of ownership of the vessel took place in July 2023, which indicates that the tanker was purchased, in particular, for the purpose of transporting russian oil. The international non-governmental organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. Under the sanctions, russia has begun to build up its own shadow fleet of outdated tankers, which has no 'ties' with the G7 and the EU and can transport oil in violation of price caps. russia disguises its shadow activities at sea under the 'convenient' flags of third countries, operates at sea without proper insurance from the international club of insurers, uses complex schemes to conceal the owners of the shadow fleet, uses various deceptive tactics to conceal the origin of its cargo, creates threats to environmental safety with large-scale economic costs for coastal countries due to the growing threat of oil spills, does not use pilots to navigate difficult areas, etc. russia's 'shadow fleet' continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On November 25, 2024, United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a tanker in connection with the transportation of russian oil/oil products from the russian federation to a third country as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In August 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the tanker's master.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/522""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/cb/08/cb0892ea6917fa766d3b3ab9a95bd55894dc366499eb0837bd8998e7fadea842-medium.webp"" alt=""NAVIGATOR RIDGE"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> NAVIGATOR RIDGE </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9321689 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> unknown </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Crude Oil Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Transportation of fossil fuels</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Transporting russian crude oil/oil products in violation of other restrictions</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">During the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and the price-cap policy on russian oil, the tanker is involved in the export of oil to third countries from russian ports, and resorts to the practice of turning off the AIS signal, conducting so-called 'dark activities' at sea. The tanker is affiliated with One Moon Marine Services LLC (UAE, under UK sanctions), a company affiliated with the sanctioned operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the export of russian oil. After its establishment, One Moon Marine Services LLC 'received' a number of tankers, including the sanctioned vessel ІМО 9394935, from the shadow fleet operators Radiating World Shipping Services and Voyages Shipping Services. Since November 2023, One Moon Marine Services LLC has started transporting russian oil without P&I insurance. Other vessels were transferred to Alqutb Ashamali Marine Services, Breath Shipping Services, etc. The constant change of owners and managers of vessels to avoid sanctions and conceal the true beneficiaries of the vessels is typical for the so-called 'shadow fleet' involved in the russian oil and oil products trade. Oil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance the war against Ukraine. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of russia's total federal revenues. The shadow tanker fleet continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the Kremlin by circumventing sanctions, disguising its activities under third-country flags, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental safety hazards with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequately insured shadow fleet tankers. On December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country. On February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel. On February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33); promoting or supporting actions/policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025). In June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.

The vessel is involved in the transportation of Venezuelan oil. In early December 2023, the tanker LIBERTY (the former name of the tanker) under the flag of Cameroon ran aground in the Strait of Malacca, which forced the Singaporean authorities to send 5 tugboats to the scene and prepare for an oil spill. In June 2023, the vessel entered the port of Ust-Luga, after which it was recorded with geometric circles off the coast of Angola in August-October. This location was previously associated with the Venezuelan dark fleet trade, in which tankers give out their location in Angola to disguise their real operations in Latin America. The vessel then sailed into the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope and arrived in Singapore in late November 2023, where it ran aground on December 2. Satellite research conducted by TankerTrackers.com claims that the LIBERTY was loaded with almost a million barrels of Venezuelan fuel oil. After the incident, the vessel changed its name from LIBERTY to VERNAL and the vessel's management. The Maritime Executive noted that Cameroon had become a 'shelter' for a shadow fleet, including those involved in the transportation of sanctioned russian oil. Vessels registered under the Cameroon flag have been linked to other oil smuggling operations, including in Iran and Venezuela. The international public organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. From July 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions on a tanker for transporting crude oil/petroleum products that originate in russia or are exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33). On August 12, 2025, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel.

The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. According to the United Against Nuclear Iran, the tanker is involved in the transportation of Iranian oil, and after the start of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has been helping russia to transport russian crude oil/petroleum products. The tanker is included in the list of ""The Maduro-Khamenei Oil Alliance: List of Foreign Flagged Vessels Shipping Iranian and Venezuelan Oil"" compiled by the United Against Nuclear Iran. According to UANI, the vessel is one of the tankers that do not belong to the sanctioned National Iranian Tanker Company, sail under foreign flags (not the flag of Iran) and participate in Iranian-Venezuelan trade, which has been actively developing since Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi signed a 20-year cooperation agreement in June 2022 to expand ties in the oil and petrochemical industries, military and economic spheres. Under this agreement, Iran supplies Venezuela with crude oil and gas condensate, and Venezuela supplies Iran with fuel oil. The tanker is connected to an incident that threatens environmental safety in the Gulf of Finland and poses significant risks to coastal countries. In February 2025, explosions occurred in the engine room of a tanker loaded with fuel oil in the port of Ust-Luga. The 24-member crew managed to reach the shore without injury, but as a result of the incident, the vessel ran aground with its stern, and the russian Emergencies Ministry installed booms around the vessel. The Federal Agency for Maritime and River Transport of russia stated that the cargo tanks of the tanker were not damaged and there was no leakage of oil products. The tanker is affiliated with the sanctioned Cypriot company Lagosmarine Limited, which was the tanker's manager. In January 2025, USA imposed sanctions on Lagosmarine Limited for its activities in the energy sector of the russian federation and as the technical manager of a crude oil tanker that made several calls to a russian port where the price of oil was constantly exceeding the price cap. After sanctions were imposed on the Cypriot company Lagosmarine Limited, the management of the vessel was changed to Vesta Shipmanagement Ltd (UAE). On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).

Such steps were taken by Russia after the successful attacks in 2023 by the Ukrainian Defence Forces against the russian tanker ‘Sig’ in the Black Sea, which was carrying out sea transport to Syria to supply jet fuel to the russian troops in Syria. From July 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions on a tanker for transporting crude oil/petroleum products that originate in russia or are exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33).

The vessel calls at ports in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, specifically the ports of Kerch and Kamysh-Burun, in November 2024. The international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment. The vessel is certified by Lloyd's Register (IACS). The tanker is affiliated with Chemul Ships Management Co LTD. Chemul Ships Management Co LTD operates another tanker, 'Spirit Of Casper' (IMO 9224271), which has been found to be involved in shadow trading activities, using deceptive shipping practices described in US government guidelines, which were often used during Iranian shipments off the coasts of Oman and the UAE to avoid detection of cargoes being loaded through ship-to-ship transfers in international waters. The owner and commercial manager of the vessel is Symi Shipping LTD (Liberia). This address in Liberia is common to other companies affiliated with shadowy oil tankers. russia's 'shadow fleet' continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental safety threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers. On January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel. According to GISIS IMO data as of July 15, 2025, the vessel's registration name is ADONIA, and the flag is designated as ""Sint Maarten False"". Since September 12, 2025, the United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on the vessel. Since October 24, 2025, the EU has imposed sanctions on the vessel. In November 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.</div> </div> <div class=""d-flex align-items-center justify-content-end pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 btn-view""> <img class=""relative transition"" src=""/resources/images/icon-arrow-right.svg"" width=""29"" height=""9"" alt=""View profile""> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-md-6 mb-4""> <a class=""d-block component-link item-cell h-100 font-small p-4"" data-pjax=""0"" href=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/en/transport/ships/542""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-4 text-center""> <img class=""photo"" src=""https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/uploads/Ships/dc/51/dc51e557d72760993c02daaa60d7a9b3d827acb7fbea46adfc7e4d1a945b24d8-medium.webp"" alt=""RANGLER"" width=""570"" height=""348""/> </div> <div class=""col-12 col-xl-8""> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel name </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold text-uppercase""> RANGLER </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> IMO </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> 9206671 </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Flag (Current) </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <span class='d-flex'><img src='/resources/images/flag/cm.svg' width='auto' height='18' alt='Cameroon'> <span class='ml-2'>Cameroon</span></span> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Vessel Type </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> Crude Oil Tanker </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""row""> <div class=""col-4 text-white""> Category </div> <div class=""col-8 yellow font-weight-bold""> <div>Cargo transportation from/to ТОТ of Ukraine</div><div><img src='/resources/images/icon-arrow-tree.svg' class='pl-1 align-top' width='13' height='14' alt='icon arrow-tree'>&nbsp;<span class='d-inline pt-02'>Calling ports of the TOT</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=""item-line pt-2 pb-2 mr-3 border-0""> <div class=""long-text-multiline text-left"">During the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and the price-cap policy on russian oil, the tanker is involved in the export of oil to third countries from russian ports in the Baltic Sea, transshipment of russian oil from ship to ship in the area of anchorages in Greece and Malta. The transshipment of oil from ship to ship off the coast of Greece and Malta is reminiscent of the activities of the so-called 'STS hubs' that emerged several years ago in the UAE, Oman and Malaysia in response to USA sanctions against Venezuelan and Iranian oil. This methodology is aimed at concealing the origin, ownership and final destination of questionable cargo. The tanker resorts to the practice of turning off the AIS signal, conducting so-called 'dark activities', in particular in the Baltic Sea. The tanker calls at ports in TOT Crimea, Ukraine, in particular, in May 2025, the vessel called at the port of Komysh-Burun. The owner and commercial manager of the vessel is Ethereal Harbor Corp, a company registered in the Seychelles. The ISM manager of the tanker is Harmony Voyage Shipmanagement, a Kazakh company. The fleet of these companies consists only of the tanker ІМО 9206671. Against the backdrop of sanctions, russia is using a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of outdated oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels.

On May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country. On May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33). On June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force. In June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.
